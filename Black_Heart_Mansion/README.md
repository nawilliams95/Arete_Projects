#### About Game

Black Heart Mantion is a halloween themed web based board game where players compete to earn the most points while trying to aviod obsticals., and deveiously stealing points from one another. 

The game flow is designed to play just as you would in real life. I felt like most online boardgames take the most fun part of playing a boardgame (player interaction) by makeing everything automated. In black Heart Mantions players pick up and roll dice, pick up and freele move character pieces around the board/ to thiere spaces and play out thier own turn!



#### How To Play

- Set Up:
    Players will pick thier player avatar/piece. players will then agree on how many turns they would like the game to last. Players take turns rolling the dice to move clockwise throughout the game board to earn points. Each board piece is assigned a certain number of points, but be careful some spaces subtract points, create obsticals like missing a turn or present challenges ! 

- How To roll the Dice:
    Players pick up the die by clicking the die on the screen and holding down the left click while shaking the mouse and then release to throw the die. Just like you were shaking them in real life!
